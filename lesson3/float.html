    <p>A mountain is a large landform that rises above the surrounding land in a limited area,
       usually in the form of a peak.[1] A mountain is generally steeper than a hill.
       Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can
       locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action
      of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits,
      but most occur in huge mountain ranges.A mountain is a large landform that rises
